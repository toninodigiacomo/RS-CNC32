# RS-CNC32
The RS-CNC32 retains the same chassis as the RS-CNC. This low-cost chassis has proven itself with makers, who have all validated it by successfully machining wood, plastics, plexiglass, composites, aluminum, and more.
The electronics GRBL 32-bit board kit, is a complete, autonomous solution that is powerful, precise, reliable, easy to use, and easy to  implement thanks to detailed tutorials.

- The GRBL 32-bit board kit is a CNC control kit for up to 4 axes.
- Its unique feature is that it is autonomous, allowing you to fully manage the  CNC without a computer thanks to its TFT touch screen, but of course it is possible to connect a computer via USB or WIFI!
- The firmware is open source, GRBL 1.1 for the control board and firmware developed by Mstrens from the forum for the TFT module.
